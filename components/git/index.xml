      <description>Most development is done on the internal Github but some code is shared with the external Bitbucket. In order to support this we have the same repo pushed to both GitHub and BitBucket.
It is best to consider GitHub and BitBucket as simply copies of the same git repository. There is no merging between GitHub and BitBucket, merging is done at the branch level and the same commit history is pushed to both systems.</description>
