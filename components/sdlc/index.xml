      <description>Semantic Version Enforcement Going forward the commit comment format will be enforced in GitHub, to allow semantic versioning of the builds. This is a basic development discipline to allow control and automation of code delivery.
This enforcement will be rolled out sympathetically to all GitHub repositories, so as not to interfere with the in flight releases.
This change consists off the format of the commit comments, from which the semantic version is derived and set of scripts to enforce and help with commits.</description>
