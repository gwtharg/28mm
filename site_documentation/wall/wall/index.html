<p>Wall fixings for hollow surfaces</p>
<p>Fixings for hollow structures (walls,ceilings and doors etc.) and how to use them</p>
<p>When fixing onto any surface the strength of the fixing is always dependent
upon the strength of the actual surface, with hollow surfaces this is generally less than for a solid structure.
It is always best with hollow surfaces to try to locate and fix into one of the support members.</p>
<p>This is not always possible and it is sometimes necessary to actually secure onto the covering, be it plaster board, hardboard or whatever.</p>
<p>When drilling relatively thin, soft materials it is not necessary or
desirable to use hammer action if a power drill is used.</p>
<p>Before drilling into any void, check for possible concealed pipes and
electric wiring.</p>
<p>Rubber-sleeved fixing with captured insert
As the screw is tightened into the rubber sleeve inserted through the
wallboard, the sleeve is compressed against the reverse side of wall.
The screw can be removed/replaced if required, the fixing will remain in
place through the wall.</p>
<p>After the required hole is drilled, the rubber sleeve is inserted
through the covering; the sleeve needs to be a fairly tight fit through
the hole to ensure that it does not rotate when the screw is tightened.
The screw is then inserted through the workpiece and into a tapped
insert, which is moulded into the back end of the sleeve.</p>
<p>The sleeve has a small rim which stands proud of the outer surface, to
allow the workpiece to sit flat against the surface, the back of the
workpiece should be relieved around the hole.</p>
<p>Various sizes are available; the screws are supplied with the fitting
although longer screws of the appropriate diameter/thread can be used
where the workpiece is too thick for the screw supplied.</p>
<p>Plastic collapsible fixing</p>
<p>Very similar to the above fixing but using an ordinary wood screw. The
fixing is used in the same manner as the above but they tend to stand up
less well to repeated screw removal/replacement as the screw tends to
cut a new thread each time it is inserted.</p>
<p>Plastic spread fixing</p>
<p>An inexpensive fixing which is not reusable - removal of the screw will
result in the fixing dropping down the cavity.</p>
<p>Drill a hole just large enough to take the head of the fixing.</p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-2_1.png" alt="index-2\_1.png"></p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-2_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>An ordinary wood screw of the appropriate length (at least equal to the
thickness of the workpiece plus the thickness of wallboard plus the
length of the fixing), is inserted through the workpiece and into the
fixing by about 2 or 3 turns. The fixing is then pushed through the hole
in the wallboard. As the fixing is pushed through, the 'legs' of the
fixing are compressed and they spring out once the fixing is through the
board.</p>
<p>The workpiece needs to be pulled away from the front surface so that the
legs of the fixings bear on the reverse side of the wall as the screw is
tightened.</p>
<p>Various sizes are available to suit various diameters of wood screw.</p>
<p>Spring metal toggle fixing</p>
<p>These fixings tend to give a stronger anchor than the plastic types
above as they spread the load over a larger area on the reverse side of
wallboard. The fixing consists of two spring-loaded metal arms with a
thread tapped into the hinge pivot. The two arms are held against the
screw as the fixing is inserted through the pre-drilled hole and then
spring out to spread the load on the reverse side of the wallboard. The
fixings cannot be reused - removal of the screw will result in the
fixing dropping down the cavity.</p>
<p>Drill a hole just large enough to allow the toggle to be pushed through
with its spring-loaded arms held together.</p>
<p>Pass the fixing screw through the workpiece into toggle. Push the toggle
through the hole until the arms spring out, pull the workpiece away from
the front surface (so that the arms bear against the reverse side of the
wallboard) and tighten the screw.</p>
<p>Various sizes are available; the screws are supplied with the fitting
although longer screws of the appropriate diameter/thread can be used
where the workpiece is too thick for the screw supplied.</p>
<p>Gravity metal toggle fixing</p>
<p>These fixings are similar to the spring type above except that the
toggle is made in one piece which is passed through the hole and then
drops down under gravity to be parallel to a vertical wallboard. These
fixings can only be used when fixing to vertical surfaces. The fixings
cannot be reused - removal of the screw will result in the toggle
dropping down the cavity.</p>
<p>Drill hole just big enough to allow the toggle to be passed through when
the toggle is parallel to the fixing screw.</p>
<p>Pass the fixing screw through the workpiece into toggle. Push the toggle
through the hole until it turns within the cavity, pull the workpiece
away from the front surface (so that the toggles bear against the
reverse side of the wallboard) and tighten the screw.</p>
<p>Various sizes are available; the screws are supplied with the fitting
although longer screws of the appropriate diameter/thread can be used
where the workpiece is too thick for the screw supplied.</p>
<p>Wall fixings for solid surfaces</p>
<p><strong>Fixing into solid brick, block or concrete</strong> When you need a fixing
into brick, block or concrete, you need to be confident that it will be
strong enough for the application - the easiest way to be confident is
to use the correct type of insert with the correct size of drill and
screw.</p>
<p>Although often referred to as 'wall' fixings, they are equally
suitable for fixing into floors or concrete beams.</p>
<p>Plugs for screws:</p>
<p>General.</p>
<p>All the plugs described below for use in solid surfaces are designed for
use with ordinary wood screws. Each basic type of plug is available in a
range of sizes to suit specific screw diameters and often for specific
length of screw. To ensure maximum strength when using a particular type
and size of plug, always follow the manufacturers recommendations
regarding the drill size and the length/size of screw.</p>
<p>Generally it does not matter what material the screw is made from or the
type of screw head, but when selecting the type of screw to use, think
about the position and environment in which it will be used. If the
screw head will be exposed, consider a brass or chrome finish, if the
screw will be used in a damp area, avoid steel or other materials which
will corrode.</p>
<p>Drilling</p>
<p>All the plugs detailed require a hole to be drilled in the brick, block
or concrete before the plug can be used. Often on internal walls, the
material will be covered with a relatively thin coating of render and/or
plaster.</p>
<p>Before drilling into any surface, check for possible concealed pipes and
electric wiring.</p>
<p>To ensure that the drill bit has a long and happy life, a
tungsten-carbide masonry drill bit should be used. The effort required
to drill the hole depends a lot upon the material being drilled:</p>
<p>Brick:</p>
<p>Brick is basically baked clay, and a good quality brick will be free of
both internal voids and internal pieces of flint, stone or other
'non-clay' material. While the hardness of bricks will vary, they can
normally be drilled accurately and cleanly. You may need to use a power
drill with a hammer action on bricks that are very hard.</p>
<p>Block:</p>
<p>Block material can vary considerably from the ultra-soft
lightweight/thermal blocks to the concrete block containing large pieces
of very hard flint etc.</p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-4_1.png" alt="index-4\_1.png"></p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-4_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lightweight blocks can be drilled very easily using a hand-brace or a
power drill without hammer action. A risk with these blocks is that they
are not very</p>
<p>'forgiving', a small amount of pressure in the wrong direction and the
drill bit will be away where you never intended it to go.</p>
<p>At the other end of the block materials, is the concrete block - these
can vary greatly in hardness and the cleanness of the final hole.
Concrete can vary both between different areas of the same block and
between blocks from different manufacturers. A drilled hole tends not to
be as clean as in brick and there is always a danger that the drill bit
will hit a piece of hard material causing the bit to wonder off the
intended line.</p>
<p>Even when no large pieces of hard material is encountered, the drill bit
will often remove smaller pieces of grit which will unintentionally
enlarge the drilled hole. A hammer action power drill is generally
required.</p>
<p>Concrete:</p>
<p>Cast concrete is different from the block version in that the material
is less 'grainy' with the particles more firmly bonded together. Like
the block material, when drilling into cast concrete, large or small
pieces of hard flint etc. may be encountered, causing the drill bit to
wonder off line, prevent drilling to an increased depth or producing a
ragged hole.</p>
<p>Most plugs need to be a push fit into the drilled hole, if the hole is
undersize, hammering the plug into the hole may damage the plug and/or
make it impossible to drive the screw home in the correct manner. Too
large a hole may make it difficult to drive the screw home (the plug may
turn in the hole as the screw is turned) or provide reduced strength
when the screw has been tightened.</p>
<p>Plastic plugs</p>
<p>These are available in a variety of lengths and for a variety of screw
sizes. The interior of the plugs will usually be designed so that when a
screw is fully inserted the end of the plug furthest from the surface
expands the greatest.</p>
<p>Drill hole to the same depth as the wall plug. Push the plug into the
hole, insert the screw through the workpiece into the plug and tighten.</p>
<p>Plastic 'plug sticks'</p>
<p>Plug sticks are sold as lengths (12 in/300mm) of a uniform cross section
along the whole length. Different diameter sticks are available for
different screw sizes - the different diameters are normally made with
differing material colours for easy identification. It is only necessary
to cut off the appropriate length after the hole has been drilled and
insert the length of stick into the hole. Although convenient, the
sticks do not give as firm a fixing as the plugs because of their
uniform cross-section.</p>
<p>Fibre plugs</p>
<p>Fibre plugs are often though of as old-fashioned however they still have
a use today. One of their advantages over plastic is that screw can be
removed/replaced a number of times without having to replace the plug.
There also tend to stand up to high temperatures better than plastic.
Fibre plugs are available in a number of lengths and diameter; they are
of a uniform cross-section along the length so can be cut down to size
if necessary. The plug should be as long as the threaded part of screw.</p>
<p>Drill the hole and insert the plug to just below the wall surface.
Insert the screw through the workpiece and turn the screw into the plug
until the plug starts to bind in the hole and then</p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-5_1.png" alt="index-5\_1.png"></p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-5_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-5_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>withdraw it so that the top of the plug is in ilne with the surface. The
plug expands to</p>
<p>fit the hole tightly as the screw is driven home.</p>
<p>Ribbed barrel plugs</p>
<p>Ribbed barrel give a really tight fit. Each plug will take a range of
screw sizes and a choice of lengths is available.</p>
<p>Drill hole slightly deeper than wall plug being used. Push the plug into
the hole, insert the screw through the workpiece into the plug and
tighten.</p>
<p>Soft materials, such as lightweight block</p>
<p>Because lightweight block is a very soft substance, special plugs are
required. These plugs tend to be like ordinary wall plugs but with
helical wings around the barrel. The helical wings grip the sides of
hole. As the screw is tightened, the wings cut further into the block
giving a very strong fixing.</p>
<p>Drill the hole the same diameter as the plug barrel. The overall
diameter of the plug will be about twice the diameter of the barrel, and
the plug will need to be hammered into the wall so that the wings cut
into the sides of the hole. Slip the screw through the workpiece into
the plug and</p>
<p>tighten.</p>
<p>Bolts and nuts metal wall inserts</p>
<p>These can offer a stronger and more temperature resistance fixing than
plastic or fibre plugs.</p>
<p>The anchoring part of the insert comprises a number of metal segments
which are forced into the side of the hole by a cone which is pulled
forward into the segments by the bolt or nut being tightened. Tightening
the nut or bolt pulls the cone into the segments but it also tends to
force the insert out of the wall if it is not held in position until the
segments begin to bite into the wall of the hole. The nuts/bolts can be
removed/replaced numerous times, the only risk is that the wall material
may be weakened by repeated application of the securing pressure.</p>
<p>Projecting type have an external screw thread which projects from the
insert. Different lengths of thread are available (from 12mm to over
75mm) to allow for different thicknesses of workpieces. The hole in the
surface only needs to be as deep as the actual insert itself.</p>
<p>Having drilled the hole just large enough for the insert, push the
insert into the hole, position the workpiece over the thread, put on the
washer and nut. Keeping the workpiece against the surface (to ensure the
insert is not pulled from the hole) tighten the nut - any excess thread
may be sawn off.</p>
<p><img src="/28mm/site_documentation/wall/wall/index-6_1.png" alt="index-6\_1.png"></p>
<p>Bolt type inserts incorporate a thread in the cone and a bolt is
inserted from the wall surface, different lengths of bolt are available
for workpieces of different thicknesses. The hole in the wall needs to
be deep enough to ensure that the bolt does not bottom when it is fully
tightened.</p>
<p>Having drilled the hole just large enough for the insert (but deep
enough for the tightened bolt), push the insert just into the hole, put
the bolt through a washer and the workpiece, offer up the workpiece and
engage the bolt into the threaded cone at the back of the insert.
Keeping the workpiece against the surface (to ensure the insert is not
pulled from the hole) tighten the bolt.</p>
