      <description>Trying colours You need to do this in html as markdown does not use colours by default.
 Some Markdown text with Simple blue coloured text.
Back to normal text. Now we can highlight in red this is red.
 Below is the html for the colours    Some Markdown text with &amp;#x3C;span style=&amp;#x22;color:blue&amp;#x22;&amp;#x3E; Simple &amp;#x3C;b&amp;#x3E;blue&amp;#x3C;/b&amp;#x3E; coloured text.&amp;#x3C;br&amp;#x3E; &amp;#x3C;/span&amp;#x3E;Back to normal text.

      <title>Branching and Merging Strategy</title>

      <description>Most development is done on the internal Github but some code is shared with the external Bitbucket. In order to support this we have the same repo pushed to both GitHub and BitBucket.
It is best to consider GitHub and BitBucket as simply copies of the same git repository. There is no merging between GitHub and BitBucket, merging is done at the branch level and the same commit history is pushed to both systems.</description>

      <description>Tables You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
so this
 First Header | Second Header ------------ | ------------- Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 Content in the first column | Content in the second column Renders as this
   First Header Second Header     Content from cell 1 Content from cell 2   Content in the first column Content in the second column    Headers # H1 ## H2 ### H3 #### H4 ##### H5 ###### H6 H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.</description>

      <description>Awful way of doing this - do not recommend PDF converted to docx [calibre] then pandoc to md file. All images needed html options removed and repointing. So this is an image jpeg Then we have png files Wall fixings for hollow surfaces
Fixings for hollow structures (walls,ceilings and doors etc.) and how to use them
When fixing onto any surface the strength of the fixing is always dependent upon the strength of the actual surface, with hollow surfaces this is generally less than for a solid structure.</description>

      <title>Semantic Version Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://gwtharg.github.io/28mm/git/semanticversionenforcement/</link>

      <guid>https://gwtharg.github.io/28mm/git/semanticversionenforcement/</guid>
      <description>Going forward the commit comment format will be enforced in GitHub, to allow semantic versioning of the builds. This is a basic development discipline to allow control and automation of code delivery.
This enforcement will be rolled out sympathetically to all GitHub repositories, so as not to interfere with the in flight releases.
This change consists off the format of the commit comments, from which the semantic version is derived and set of scripts to enforce and help with commits.</description>

      <description>Test clip from document Aim of the Document This document is an attempt to guide TFS administrators through the process required to create a more complex hierarchical structure under the VM project folder.
We will run through an example using the IIB Technical Team to guide you through the process.
Initial Considerations Most importantly is that we have had a discussion with the users to understand what it they wish to achieve.</description>
