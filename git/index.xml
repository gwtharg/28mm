      <title>Versioning Strategy</title>

      <description>The document describes the versioning strategy for deliverable componenets.
While we will be using semantic versioning and each release will be tagged with its semantic version, only major versions of each component will be supported in production.
So for each major version in production we will have a named branch. What we mean by &amp;lsquo;named branch&amp;rsquo; is a branch this is long lived, has forked of master and it will trigger a pipeline release on checkin.</description>

      <title>Branching and Merging Strategy</title>

      <description>Most development is done on the internal Github but some code is shared with the external Bitbucket. In order to support this we have the same repo pushed to both GitHub and BitBucket.
It is best to consider GitHub and BitBucket as simply copies of the same git repository. There is no merging between GitHub and BitBucket, merging is done at the branch level and the same commit history is pushed to both systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Version Enforcement</title>

      <description>Going forward the commit comment format will be enforced in GitHub, to allow semantic versioning of the builds. This is a basic development discipline to allow control and automation of code delivery.
This enforcement will be rolled out sympathetically to all GitHub repositories, so as not to interfere with the in flight releases.
This change consists off the format of the commit comments, from which the semantic version is derived and set of scripts to enforce and help with commits.</description>
