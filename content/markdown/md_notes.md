## Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

so this
```

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```
Renders as this

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
