# Test clip from document

#### Aim of the Document 

This document is an attempt to guide TFS administrators through the
process required to create a more complex hierarchical structure under
the VM project folder.

We will run through an example using the IIB Technical Team to guide you
through the process.

#### Initial Considerations

Most importantly is that we have had a discussion with the users to
understand what it they wish to achieve. If teams require to view the
results of queries from other teams & have the ability to show those on
a common dashboard then this may be a reason to create a more complex
structure. If the user just requires to be a member of many teams then
this is not a valid reason to create a more complex structure.

***Note** -- rights to view work/code/queries will be inherited with
this model. So **any** team on a lower level must consent to this before
creating any complex structure.*
